### Assignment 1



##### Question 1:

Holds in a specific threshold value that we want to reach. Once the product becomes greater than our threshold value is when the program outputs the final product number and the integer we reached in order to pass the threshold.

##### Question 2:

Takes in a specific list of strings and divides each string into they're own dictionary. The strings become the keys and the values are separate dictionaries that contain the length of the word and the parity of length of the word (either even or odd).

##### Question 3:

A function that takes a number "x" and a number "y", where "x" is the base and "y" becomes an exponent that is attached to "x". The function skips any "y" that is less than 0 and finally stores the sorted list which it later prints to the console.

##### Question 4:

Generates a random list full of numbers between 0 and 1(for example a list of 20 numbers between 0 and 1). At the same time it generates a variable "x" that has a numeric value also between 0 and 1. The program then finds all indices that contains a number equal to or greater than our random variable "x" and records them into a sorted list ordered lowest to greatest. It then finds the first index that it recorded being greater than or equal to "x". Using all these recorded values it prints out the final sorted list, value of "x", and the first matching index.

##### Question 5:

This program creates a function that takes the radius of two different circles that must be positive integers. Then using the radius, it computes the area of both circles. It then finds which circle is smaller and which circle is bigger and overlays the smaller circle over the bigger circle to see the percentage area the smaller circle takes up.

##### Question 6:

This program generates a function that intakes a list of numbers and turns them into a sorted dictionary. The keys are unique values found in the list and the values are percentage of elements in the list that are equal to or less than the specific key. Note that the lowest percentage a unique key can be is at least 1/x, where x is the number of elements in said list. That's because when comparing to all the elements found in the list it compares itself to the same initial unique key(it accounts for itself in the comparison).

##### Question 7:

This program converts seconds after midnight into hours, minutes, and the remaining seconds. The seconds inputted cannot be less than 0 or greater than 86399 because 86400 is the amount of seconds it takes for 24 hours to past. After 12 hours the program switches specific time period. So if it started in "AM", after 12 hours it will swap to "PM" while retaining the amount of hours, minutes, and seconds spent after midnight.

##### Question 8:

This program uses a library known as Pandas to create a data frame. It takes in a dictionary of alphabetical keys and a specific list of numbers as it's values. Using the data stored in two of the columns "C" and "B" it creates a brand new column named "D" which is the product of dividing the values of column "C" by column "B" and inserting them in each corresponding column for "D".

##### Question 9:

This is the Readme.md file needed for Question 9. It explains the premise and purpose of each program added in this repository.
